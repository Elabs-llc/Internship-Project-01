# Internship-Project-01
This Python project scrapes data from multiple websites, processes it in real-time using generators, and generates reports. It uses decorators for logging and error handling, lambda functions for sorting and filtering, and list comprehensions for data cleaning. The tool is efficient and designed for large-scale web scraping tasks.
